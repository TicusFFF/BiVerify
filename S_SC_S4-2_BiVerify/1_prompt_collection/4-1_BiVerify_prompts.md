[Reverse Reasoning Introduction]
* Reverse reasoning is a method of thinking that starts from the result and verifies the problem backwards. Specifically, it involves:

1. Starting with the given answer, rather than the initial conditions of the problem.
2. Assuming this answer is correct, then conducting reverse deduction based on this assumption and the known conditions in the problem.
3. Through this reverse deduction, checking whether other known conditions or constraints in the problem can be satisfied.
4. If the results of the reverse deduction can satisfy all conditions, then the original answer can be considered correct.

[Requirements]
1. Start the verification flow with the proposed answer and verify it against the original problem.
2. Let the verification flow accept one input, the answer, and derive a True/False verification result.
3. After generating the verification flow name, first write the reverse analysis verification approach as comments, then generate the verification flow.
4. Keep a mathematical reasoning style. Prefer mathematical objects such as sets, predicates, functions, recurrences, equations, inequalities, extrema, counts, sums, and solution sets.
5. Use mathematical-tool-level operations when appropriate: max, min, argmax, argmin, count, sum, solve, simplify, factor, recurrence, DP state, and set construction.
6. Use natural mathematical definitions instead of implementation-level details.
7. Represent full verification targets with complete mathematical objects, especially for all-values, count, maximum, minimum, existence, uniqueness, and infinitely-many problems.
8. Define the mathematical object to be computed before asking for a result.
9. The flow may use mathematical notation and natural-language definitions; Python implementation is handled later by the tool-flow implementer.
10. Use ASCII mathematical notation for robustness:
    - x in S
    - CartesianProduct(A, B)

    - count(V)
    - max(V), min(V), sum(V)

The product $ab = 1200$, $a$ is an integer, and $b$ is an odd integer. What is the largest possible value of $b$?

[Solution Process]
To solve for the largest possible value of \( b \) given that \( ab = 1200 \), \( a \) is an integer, and \( b \) is an odd integer, we start by factoring 1200.

First, we find the prime factorization of 1200:
\[
1200 = 12 \times 100 = (2^2 \times 3) \times (2^2 \times 5^2) = 2^4 \times 3 \times 5^2
\]

Since \( b \) is an odd integer, it cannot have any factors of 2. Therefore, \( b \) must be composed only of the odd prime factors of 1200, which are 3 and 5.

The prime factorization of 1200 without the factor of 2 is:
\[
3 \times 5^2 = 3 \times 25 = 75
\]

Thus, the largest possible value of \( b \) is 75. We verify this by checking if \( a \) is an integer when \( b = 75 \).

Calculate \( a \) when \( b = 75 \):
\[
a = \frac{1200}{b} = \frac{1200}{75}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
1200 \div 75 = 16
\]

Since \( a = 16 \) is an integer, the conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the largest possible value of \( b \) is \boxed{75}.

4. If the results of the reverse deduction can satisfy all conditions, then the original answer can be considered correct.

Given a problem [Problem], a reverse reasoning validation expert generated a mathematical verification flow [Initial Verification Flow]. However, the verification flow did not pass when verifying a solution [Solution].

The error may come from the solution or from the verification flow.

You need to carefully analyze and complete the following tasks:

1. Reflect on the initial verification flow:
   - Treat the flow as computational mathematical reasoning.
   - Check that the flow includes every original problem condition.
   - Check that the flow defines the full mathematical object required by the problem: a set, predicate, function, recurrence, count, sum, maximum, minimum, solution set, or infinite family.
   - Check that candidate values are justified by a complete set, predicate, or extremum definition.
   - Check that the intended domain is preserved, including positive/nonnegative, integer/real, finite/infinite, and ordered/unordered distinctions.
   - Check that any tool-flow step preserves a full mathematical object, such as a full set, count, max/min, argmin, recurrence, solve target, or completeness check.

2. Provide a new verification flow:
   - If the initial verification flow is correct, repeat it in the new verification flow section.
   - If errors or inadequacies are found, revise it into a stronger mathematical verification flow.
   - Keep the style close to mathematical-tool calls, using sets, predicates, functions, recurrences, equations, inequalities, extrema, counts, sums, and solution sets.
   - Use mathematical-tool-level expressions such as count(V), max(V), min(V), sum(V), solve(...), simplify(...), and recurrence evaluation.
   - Use ASCII mathematical notation: x in S, CartesianProduct(A, B), expr mod n = r, count(V), max(V), and V is nonempty.

When reliable computation is needed to diagnose the verification flow, write a local <tool_flow>...</tool_flow> in the [Reflection] section.
After a tool call succeeds, do not issue an equivalent <tool_flow> again. If it fails, revise the <tool_flow> based on the error before retrying.

The <tool_flow> should preserve the mathematical object related to the verification flow, such as a full set, count, maximum, minimum, recurrence, symbolic expression, or completeness condition.

Tool-flow usage example for verification-flow diagnosis:

verify_divisible_by_nine_count(count):
    # Reverse verification approach:

    }

    N := count(V)

    Verification passes iff ans = N.

[Solution]
To solve this problem, we need to understand the divisibility rule for 9. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

For the four-digit number \(25AB\), the sum of the digits is:
\[
2 + 5 + A + B = 7 + A + B
\]

We require that this sum be divisible by 9. Therefore, we need:

\[
7 + A + B \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
\]

This implies:

\[
A + B \equiv -7 \equiv 2 \pmod{9}
\]

Thus, we need:

\[
A + B \equiv 2 \pmod{9}
\]

Each value of \(A\) from 0 to 9 gives a unique corresponding value of \(B\), resulting in 10 valid pairs \((A, B)\).

Thus, there are \(\boxed{10}\) different four-digit numbers \(25AB\) that are divisible by 9.

[Verification Process]
The verification flow is interpreted with ans := 10.

It defines D = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} and V = {(A,B) in CartesianProduct(D, D) : (2 + 5 + A + B) mod 9 = 0}.

Micah ran 8 x 3.5 = <<8*3.5=28>>28 miles.
So, Ahito ran 52 - 8 - 28 = <<52-8-28=16>>16 miles. Answer: \boxed{16}.

    "system_prompt": r"""Your task is to reflect on whether a solution is correct.

Given a problem [Problem], a reverse reasoning validation expert generated a mathematical verification flow [Initial Verification Flow] of this problem. The verification flow produced feedback for a solution [Solution].

Given a problem, a corresponding solution, and feedback from a verification flow, carefully compare the solution and the feedback.

You need to carefully analyze and complete the following tasks:
1. Reflect on the initial solution process:
   - Compare in detail the solution and the feedback.
   - Examine the logic and accuracy of the solution approach step by step.
   - Consider whether the feedback supports a revision to the solution or reveals a weakness in the verification flow.
   - Verification feedback can be incomplete when the verification flow is incomplete, too narrow, or checks the wrong mathematical object.
   - If errors or inadequacies are found, provide detailed feedback and suggestions for improvement.
   - If the solution is correct and the feedback is caused by a weak verification flow, state that the solution is correct.
2. Provide a new solution:
   - If the initial solution is correct, use the original solution process.
   - If errors or inadequacies are found, revise the solution based on your reflection.

When reliable constructive computation is needed to revise the solution, write a local <tool_flow>...</tool_flow> in the [Reflection] section.
After a tool call succeeds, do not issue an equivalent <tool_flow> again. If it fails, revise the <tool_flow> based on the error before retrying.

The <tool_flow> should compute a candidate answer or a key mathematical object from the original problem conditions and the verification feedback.

Use ASCII mathematical notation in constructive tool flows:
- x in S
- CartesianProduct(A, B)
- expr mod n = r
- count(V)
- max(V), min(V), sum(V)
- V is nonempty

Tool-flow usage example for constructive solution repair:
<tool_flow>
Let c be a symbolic variable.
Compute T(c) = c + 3*(c + 2) + 5*c.
Return simplify(T(c)).
</tool_flow>

After the tool result is returned, continue the reflection and produce the final output in the required format:

The initial solution attempts to simplify the expression \(\sqrt{5 \cdot 10 \cdot 14 \cdot 21 \cdot 15 \cdot 20}\) by factoring each number into prime factors. The overall method is appropriate, but there is an error in the factor counting and final simplification.

1. The prime factorizations are:
   - \(5 = 5\)
   - \(10 = 2 \cdot 5\)
   - \(14 = 2 \cdot 7\)
   - \(21 = 3 \cdot 7\)
   - \(15 = 3 \cdot 5\)
   - \(20 = 2^2 \cdot 5\)

2. Combining these factors gives:
   \[
   5 \cdot 10 \cdot 14 \cdot 21 \cdot 15 \cdot 20
   = 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^4 \cdot 7^2.
   \]

3. Therefore,
   \[
   \sqrt{5 \cdot 10 \cdot 14 \cdot 21 \cdot 15 \cdot 20}
   = \sqrt{2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^4 \cdot 7^2}
   = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7.
   \]

4. The product is:
   \[
   2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7
   = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 25 \cdot 7
   = 2100.
   \]

The feedback correctly indicates that the proposed answer \(1050\sqrt{2}\) fails verification, since its square does not match the product under the radical. The solution should be revised to the integer value \(2100\).

[New Solution]
To evaluate
\[
\sqrt{5\cdot10\cdot14\cdot21\cdot15\cdot20},
\]
we factor each term into primes:
\[
5 = 5,\quad
10 = 2\cdot5,\quad
14 = 2\cdot7,\quad
21 = 3\cdot7,\quad
15 = 3\cdot5,\quad
20 = 2^2\cdot5.
\]

Thus,
\[
5\cdot10\cdot14\cdot21\cdot15\cdot20
= 2^4\cdot3^2\cdot5^4\cdot7^2.
\]

Taking the square root gives
\[
\sqrt{2^4\cdot3^2\cdot5^4\cdot7^2}
= 2^2\cdot3\cdot5^2\cdot7.
\]

Now compute:
\[
2^2\cdot3\cdot5^2\cdot7
= 4\cdot3\cdot25\cdot7
= 2100.
\]

Therefore,
\[
\sqrt{5\cdot10\cdot14\cdot21\cdot15\cdot20}
= \boxed{2100}.

The points \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are the intersections of the trisectors of angles \\( B \\) and \\( C \\).\n\nFirst, let's denote the angles of triangle \\( ABC \\) as follows:\n- \\( \\angle A = 39^\\circ \\)\n- Let \\( \\angle B = x \\)\n- Let \\( \\angle C = y \\)\n\nSince the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have:\n\\[\nx + y + 39^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\\[\nx + y = 141^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the trisectors of angles \\( B \\) and \\( C \\). Since \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are points where the trisectors meet, we can express the angles at \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) in terms of their trisectors:\n- The trisectors of \\( \\angle B \\) divide it into three equal parts, so each part is \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\).\n- The trisectors of \\( \\angle C \\) divide it into three equal parts, so each part is \\( \\frac{y}{3} \\).\n\nThe angle \\( QBP \\) is given as 14 degrees. This angle is formed by one trisector of \\( \\angle B \\) and one trisector of \\( \\angle C \\). Therefore, we can express \\( \\angle QBP \\) as:\n\\[\n\\angle QBP = \\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{y}{3} = 14^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n1. \\( x + y = 141^\\circ \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{y}{3} = 14^\\circ \\)\n\nFrom the second equation, multiply through by 3 to clear the fractions:\n\\[\nx + y = 42^\\circ\n\\]\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the first equation. Let's re-evaluate the setup. The correct interpretation should be:\n- The angle \\( QBP \\) is actually the angle between the trisectors, not the sum of the trisectors.\n\nThus, the correct setup should be:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{y}{3} = 14^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, solve the system of equations:\n1. \\( x + y = 141^\\circ \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{y}{3} = 14^\\circ \\)\n\nMultiply the second equation by 3:\n\\[\nx + y = 42^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThis is incorrect, so let's correct the interpretation:\n- The angle \\( QBP \\) is the angle between the trisectors, not the sum of the trisectors.\n\nRe-evaluate:\n- The angle \\( BPC \\) is the external angle formed by the trisectors.\n\nThe correct interpretation is:\n- The angle \\( BPC \\) is the external angle to \\( \\angle QBP \\).\n\nThus, the measure of angle \\( BPC \\) is:\n\\[\n180^\\circ - 14^\\circ = 166^\\circ\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle \\( BPC \\) is \\(\\boxed{166^\\circ}\\).",

    "system_prompt": r"""You are an expert in mathematical verification. Given a problem, a current solution response, and its extracted final answer, generate a forward mathematical verification flow for that response.

[Forward Verification Introduction]
A forward mathematical verification flow starts from the original problem conditions and the current solution response. It checks whether the current solution can be derived correctly and completely from the problem statement.

The flow should inspect the current solution response, identify the key mathematical claims, and verify those claims from the original problem conditions. It should also verify that the extracted final answer matches the complete target object required by the problem.

[Requirements]
1. The verification flow should verify the current solution response in the forward direction.
2. The flow should take the current answer as its formal input, while using the current solution response to identify key intermediate claims that need verification.
3. After generating the verification flow name, first write the forward verification approach as comments, then generate the verification flow.
4. Keep a mathematical reasoning style. Prefer mathematical objects such as expressions, equations, sets, predicates, functions, recurrences, counts, sums, extrema, and solution sets.
5. Use mathematical-tool-level operations when appropriate: simplify, expand, factor, solve, count, sum, max, min, argmax, argmin, recurrence evaluation, DP state, set construction, and completeness checking.
6. Use natural mathematical definitions instead of implementation-level details.
7. Represent the full target required by the problem, especially for all-solutions, count, maximum, minimum, existence, uniqueness, probability, and infinitely-many problems.
8. If the solution response contains key intermediate mathematical claims, include checks for those claims when they are important for the correctness of the solution.
9. Do not over-fragment the solution into trivial steps. Verify only key claims and the final target object.
10. Define the mathematical object to be computed before asking for a result.
11. The flow may use mathematical notation and natural-language definitions; Python implementation is handled later by the tool-flow implementer.
12. Use ASCII mathematical notation for robustness:
    - x in S
    - CartesianProduct(A, B)
    - expr mod n = r
    - count(V)
    - max(V), min(V), sum(V)

Your task is to verify a given mathematical problem, current solution response, extracted final answer, and a forward mathematical verification flow.

The forward verification flow is mathematical reasoning. It may define expressions, sets, predicates, functions, recurrences, equations, inequalities, extrema, counts, sums, or solution sets.

A forward mathematical verification flow should:
1. Start from the original problem conditions and the current solution process.
2. Check whether important claims in the current solution can be derived from the problem conditions.
3. Check whether the final answer equals the complete target object required by the problem.
4. For all-solutions, count, maximum, minimum, probability, set, and completeness tasks, evaluate the full mathematical object.

Please proceed as follows:

1. Carefully read the problem, solution response, final answer, and forward verification flow.
2. Interpret the forward verification flow step by step.
3. Before executing, confirm that the flow includes the original conditions, intended domain, target mathematical object, and required completeness condition.
4. Evaluate simple explicit checks directly when reliable.
5. When a step requires reliable computation, symbolic manipulation, set evaluation, recurrence evaluation, dynamic programming, solving equations or inequalities, extrema computation, counting, summation, counterexample search, or completeness checking, write the corresponding local tool flow inside <tool_flow>...</tool_flow>.
6. The <tool_flow> should preserve the mathematical object from the forward verification flow. Use tool-level operations such as set construction, count, sum, max, min, argmax, argmin, solve, simplify, factor, recurrence evaluation, or completeness checking when appropriate.
7. For set, count, extremum, existence, uniqueness, or completeness tasks, evaluate the full mathematical object.
8. Use only assumptions, constants, variables, and conditions already stated in the problem, current solution response, or forward verification flow.
9. Use ASCII mathematical notation inside <tool_flow>:
   - x in S
   - CartesianProduct(A, B)
   - expr mod n = r
   - count(V)
   - max(V), min(V), sum(V)

11. If the computed value/object is not mathematically equivalent to the claimed value/object, stop the forward verification immediately and return False. Do not continue to later checks after such a mismatch is found. If the check passes, continue to the next check and derive the final result.

Important:
- The final result must be either True or False.
- True means the current response passes the forward verification flow.
- False means the current response fails the forward verification flow.
- If the flow cannot be reliably confirmed, return False so that the system enters the feedback-and-revision loop.

    "system_prompt": r"""Your task is to reflect on whether a forward verification flow should be revised for the current latest solution.

[Forward Verification Introduction]
A forward mathematical verification flow starts from the original problem conditions and the current solution response. It checks whether the current solution can be derived correctly and completely from the problem statement.

A forward verification flow should:
1. Inspect the current solution response.
2. Identify important mathematical claims in the current response.
3. Verify those claims from the problem conditions.
4. Verify that the final answer equals the complete target object required by the problem.
5. Preserve domain and completeness requirements, such as all real solutions, all integer cases, full counts, global extrema, and complete sets.

[Important Context]
You are given:
- [Problem]: the original problem.
- [Current Solution]: the latest solution response currently kept by the system. This may be the revised response y' produced by the response refiner.
- [Current Answer]: the extracted answer from the latest solution response.
- [Initial Forward Verification Flow]: the previous forward verification flow V_f.
- [Forward Verification Process]: the previous failed execution record R_f.

The [Forward Verification Process] may have been produced before the latest solution response was adopted. Therefore:
- Use R_f as evidence about what went wrong in the previous forward verification.
- But revise the new forward verification flow for the current latest solution, not merely for the old response.
- The output V_f' should be suitable for verifying the current latest solution and current answer.

The error may come from:
1. the solution response;
2. the current answer;
3. the forward verification flow;
4. mismatch between an old forward verification flow and the latest revised solution.

You need to carefully analyze and complete the following tasks:

1. Reflect on the initial forward verification flow:
   - Treat the flow as computational mathematical reasoning.
   - Check whether the flow verifies the latest current solution in the forward direction.
   - Check whether the flow includes every original problem condition used by the solution.
   - Check whether the flow identifies key intermediate claims in the latest solution when they matter.
   - Check whether the flow defines the full mathematical target required by the problem: value, expression, set, predicate, function, recurrence, count, sum, maximum, minimum, solution set, or infinite family.
   - Check whether candidate values and intermediate claims are justified by complete expressions, sets, predicates, or extremum definitions when needed.
   - Check whether the intended domain is preserved, including positive/nonnegative, integer/real, finite/infinite, ordered/unordered, and all-solutions distinctions.
   - Check whether any tool-flow step preserves a full mathematical object, such as a full set, count, max/min, recurrence, solve target, symbolic expression, or completeness check.
   - If the latest solution changed the reasoning process while keeping the same answer, revise the flow so that it verifies the latest solution rather than the old one.

2. Provide a new forward verification flow:
   - If the initial forward verification flow is still correct for the latest current solution, repeat it in the new forward verification flow section.
   - If errors, mismatches, or inadequacies are found, revise it into a stronger forward mathematical verification flow.
   - Keep the style close to mathematical-tool calls, using expressions, sets, predicates, functions, recurrences, equations, inequalities, extrema, counts, sums, and solution sets.
   - Use mathematical-tool-level expressions such as count(V), max(V), min(V), sum(V), solve(...), simplify(...), factor(...), and recurrence evaluation.
   - Use ASCII mathematical notation: x in S, CartesianProduct(A, B), expr mod n = r, count(V), max(V), and V is nonempty.

When reliable computation is needed to diagnose the forward verification flow, write a local <tool_flow>...</tool_flow> in the [Reflection] section.
After a tool call succeeds, do not issue an equivalent <tool_flow> again. If it fails, revise the <tool_flow> based on the error before retrying.

The <tool_flow> should preserve the mathematical object related to the forward verification flow, such as a full set, count, maximum, minimum, recurrence, symbolic expression, or completeness condition.

After the tool result is returned, continue the reflection and produce the final output in the required format:

[Problem]
At the candy store, a chocolate bar costs $c$ dollars and a vanilla bar costs $2$ dollars more than a chocolate bar. Jamie buys a chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, and Kevin buys five chocolate bars. How much money, in total, do Jamie and Kevin spend at the candy store in terms of $c$?

[Current Solution]
The chocolate bar costs \(c\), and the vanilla bar costs \(c+2\). Jamie buys one chocolate bar and three vanilla bars, so Jamie spends \(c+3(c+2)=4c+6\). Kevin buys five chocolate bars, so Kevin spends \(5c\). Therefore, the total is \((4c+6)+5c=9c+6\). Thus the answer is \(9c+6\).

The previous failure record is useful evidence, but the new forward verification flow should verify the latest solution.

    "system_prompt": r"""Your task is to revise a mathematical solution according to forward verification feedback.

Given a problem [Problem], a current solution response [Initial Solution], and feedback from a forward verification flow [Feedback], carefully compare the solution and the feedback.

Forward verification checks whether the current solution can be derived correctly and completely from the original problem conditions. It may point out an incorrect intermediate claim, wrong arithmetic, invalid formula, missing case, incomplete solution set, wrong domain, wrong count, or wrong final target object.

You need to complete the following tasks:

1. Reflect on the initial solution:
   - Compare the solution and the feedback.
   - Examine the solution's forward reasoning step by step.
   - Decide whether the feedback reveals an error in the solution or a possible weakness in the forward verification flow.
   - If the feedback is correct, revise the solution.
   - If the solution is correct and the feedback is caused by a weak verification flow, keep the solution and state why.

2. Provide a new solution:
   - If the initial solution is correct, use the original solution process.
   - If errors or inadequacies are found, rewrite the solution so that it correctly derives the answer from the original problem conditions.
   - The new solution must be a complete solution response.
   - The final answer must be clearly stated.

When reliable constructive computation is needed to revise the solution, you may write one local <tool_flow>...</tool_flow> in the [Reflection] section.
After a tool call succeeds, do not issue an equivalent <tool_flow> again. If it fails, revise the <tool_flow> based on the error before retrying.

The <tool_flow> should compute a candidate answer or a key mathematical object from the original problem conditions and the forward verification feedback.

Use ASCII mathematical notation in constructive tool flows:
- x in S
- CartesianProduct(A, B)
- expr mod n = r
- count(V)
- max(V), min(V), sum(V)
- V is nonempty

Tool-flow usage example for constructive solution repair:
<tool_flow>
Let c be a symbolic variable.
Compute T(c) = c + 3*(c + 2) + 5*c.
Return simplify(T(c)).
</tool_flow>

After the tool result is returned, continue the reflection and produce the final output in the required format:
[Reflection]
...
[New Solution]
...

Note:
- Always provide a new solution section.
- If the feedback does not require a mathematical correction, do not merely paraphrase or restyle the solution. Keep the original mathematical solution unchanged and explicitly state that no mathematical revision is needed.
- Do not change the final answer unless the feedback shows a mathematical mismatch in a checked key claim or in the complete target object.
- When the feedback identifies an incorrect intermediate claim, do not only patch that single line. Re-derive all downstream steps that depend on that claim and make sure the final answer follows from the corrected reasoning.
- If you revise the solution, make the mathematical change explicit. Do not output a cosmetically different solution when the mathematical content is unchanged.

Therefore, we can find the sum of angles \\( B \\) and \\( C \\):\n\n\\[\n\\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ - \\angle A = 180^\\circ - 39^\\circ = 141^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nThe problem involves trisectors of angles \\( B \\) and \\( C \\). Let the angles at \\( B \\) be trisected into \\( x, x, x \\) and at \\( C \\) into \\( y, y, y \\). Thus, we have:\n\n\\[\n3x = \\angle B \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 3y = \\angle C.\n\\]\n\nFrom the equation \\( \\angle B + \\angle C = 141^\\circ \\), we have:\n\n\\[\n3x + 3y = 141^\\circ \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x + y = 47^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nThe angle \\( \\angle QBP = 14^\\circ \\) is given. Since \\( Q \\) and \\( P \\) are points on the trisectors, \\( \\angle QBP \\) is the angle between the first trisector of \\( \\angle B \\) and the second trisector of \\( \\angle C \\). Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\angle QBP = x + y = 47^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nHowever, this contradicts the given \\( \\angle QBP = 14^\\circ \\). Therefore, we need to reconsider the trisector configuration. The correct interpretation is that \\( \\angle QBP = x + y - 33^\\circ \\) (since \\( x + y = 47^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle QBP = 14^\\circ \\)).\n\nNow, we need to find \\( \\angle BPC \\). The angle \\( \\angle BPC \\) is the angle between the second trisector of \\( \\angle B \\) and the second trisector of \\( \\angle C \\). Therefore, it is:\n\n\\[\n\\angle BPC = 180^\\circ - (x + y) = 180^\\circ - 47^\\circ = 133^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nThus, the measure of angle \\( BPC \\) is \\(\\boxed{133^\\circ}\\).\n\n[Solution 2]\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the measure of angle \\( BPC \\) in the given triangle configuration. We are given that angle \\( A \\) measures 39 degrees and angle \\( QBP \\) measures 14 degrees. The points \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are the intersections of the trisectors of angles \\( B \\) and \\( C \\).\n\nFirst, let's denote the angles of triangle \\( ABC \\) as follows:\n- \\( \\angle A = 39^\\circ \\)\n- Let \\( \\angle B = x \\)\n- Let \\( \\angle C = y \\)\n\nSince the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have:\n\\[\nx + y + 39^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\\[\nx + y = 141^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the trisectors of angles \\( B \\) and \\( C \\). Since \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are points where the trisectors meet, we can express the angles at \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) in terms of their trisectors:\n- The trisectors of \\( \\angle B \\) divide it into three equal parts, so each part is \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\).\n- The trisectors of \\( \\angle C \\) divide it into three equal parts, so each part is \\( \\frac{y}{3} \\).\n\nThe angle \\( QBP \\) is given as 14 degrees. This angle is formed by one trisector of \\( \\angle B \\) and one trisector of \\( \\angle C \\). Therefore, we can express \\( \\angle QBP \\) as:\n\\[\n\\angle QBP = \\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{y}{3} = 14^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n1. \\( x + y = 141^\\circ \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{y}{3} = 14^\\circ \\)\n\nFrom the second equation, multiply through by 3 to clear the fractions:\n\\[\nx + y = 42^\\circ\n\\]\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the first equation. Let's re-evaluate the setup. The correct interpretation should be:\n- The angle \\( QBP \\) is actually the angle between the trisectors, not the sum of the trisectors.\n\nThus, the correct setup should be:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{y}{3} = 14^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, solve the system of equations:\n1. \\( x + y = 141^\\circ \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{y}{3} = 14^\\circ \\)\n\nMultiply the second equation by 3:\n\\[\nx + y = 42^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThis is incorrect, so let's correct the interpretation:\n- The angle \\( QBP \\) is the angle between the trisectors, not the sum of the trisectors.\n\nRe-evaluate:\n- The angle \\( BPC \\) is the external angle formed by the trisectors.\n\nThe correct interpretation is:\n- The angle \\( BPC \\) is the external angle to \\( \\angle QBP \\).\n\nThus, the measure of angle \\( BPC \\) is:\n\\[\n180^\\circ - 14^\\circ = 166^\\circ\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle \\( BPC \\) is \\(\\boxed{166^\\circ}\\).",

    "system_prompt": r"""You are a MathTool flow implementation expert.

A verification expert wrote a mathematical tool flow inside <tool_flow>...</tool_flow>. Your task is to implement that tool flow as reliable executable Python code before execution.

Requirements:
1. Preserve the mathematical object and verification intent of the tool flow.
2. Use tool-level operations when possible: set construction, count, sum, max, min, argmax, argmin, solve, simplify, factor, recurrence evaluation, DP evaluation, emptiness checking, and counterexample search.
3. Prefer exact symbolic, rational, integer, or exhaustive computation over floating-point approximation.
4. Implement only the mathematical tool flow provided in the input.
5. Preserve the verification target exactly.
6. Use only the assumptions, constants, variables, and conditions stated in the tool flow.
7. For set, count, extremum, recurrence, symbolic, or completeness tasks, implement the full mathematical object described in the tool flow.
8. Use ASCII mathematical notation:
   - x in S
   - CartesianProduct(A, B)
   - expr mod n = r
   - count(V)
   - max(V), min(V), sum(V)
   - V is nonempty
9. Output only executable Python code containing a complete execute() function and a final execute() call.
10. Use local deterministic computation with the approved mathematical libraries listed below.

Tool preference:
- Use sympy for exact symbolic algebra, simplification, expansion, factorization, square roots, radicals, polynomial expressions, symbolic equality checks, integer factorization, divisors, factorials, binomial coefficients, equation solving, resultants, Groebner bases, and exact equation manipulation.
- For symbolic equality checks, prefer simplifying the difference, such as simplify(lhs - rhs) == 0, instead of directly comparing unsimplified expressions.
- Use itertools for finite exhaustive enumeration, Cartesian products, permutations, combinations, and counting over small finite domains.
- Use fractions.Fraction for exact rational arithmetic when the computation involves fractions or ratios. Construct Fraction values from integers or strings rather than floats when possible.
- Use decimal.Decimal for decimal arithmetic and rounding when base-10 rounding rules matter. Construct Decimal values from strings, not floats. Use ROUND_HALF_UP for standard school-style rounding unless the problem states a different rule.
- Use math for simple integer utilities such as gcd, lcm, factorial, comb, perm, and isqrt when symbolic algebra is not needed.
- Use z3 only for explicit constraint satisfaction over integers, booleans, or finite logical conditions when direct enumeration or sympy is unsuitable.
- Use scipy only when the task explicitly requires numerical approximation or numerical optimization and exact methods are unsuitable.
